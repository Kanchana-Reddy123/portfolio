  <h3>Project Spotlight</h3>
  
  <h4>Software Licensing System – Bharat Electronics Ltd (Internship Project)</h4>
  <p>
    Thrilled to share that I successfully completed my first project at Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)! I developed a Software Licensing System using Python, incorporating RSA encryption for secure key generation, validation, and verification.
  </p>
  <p>
    To strengthen the system, I implemented SHA-256 and MD5 hashing algorithms to ensure data integrity. I also built a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter, merging security and usability into a complete solution.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project gave me valuable hands-on experience in applying real-world encryption techniques and developing secure applications from scratch.

  <h4>Alphanumeric Character Detection System – Bharat Electronics Ltd (Mar–Jul 2025)</h4>
  <p>
    As part of my internship at Bharat Electronics Ltd, I developed a GUI-based system that detects and extracts alphanumeric character positions from static images using image processing techniques in Python. The system leverages OpenCV for preprocessing and Tesseract OCR for character recognition.
  </p>
  <p>
    I designed an interactive GUI using Tkinter to allow users to upload images and visually view the detected text along with their exact positions. This project enhanced my skills in image preprocessing, OCR, and GUI development for real-time, user-facing applications.

  <h4>HTML Mail Dispatcher – Exposys Data Labs (Nov–Dec 2023)</h4>
  <p>
    During my internship at Exposys Data Labs, I developed an automated HTML email dispatcher system that handled daily email communication tasks. The tool generated customized HTML-based messages and dispatched them to multiple recipients efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project improved my understanding of HTML email structures, basic backend automation, and SMTP email handling using Python. It also gave me real-world experience in managing batch email workflows and integrating automation into daily operations.
